## About Me & This Page

<p>Hello, my name is Kathryn Chiang. I am a statistics student in University of California, Davis. During my freshman year in college, I was majoring in Animal Science. However, I found statistics interesting, so I changed my major to Applied Statistics. Now, I am graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Statistics. Statistics 141B, a Statistics Data Technologies course, is one of the best course I have taken in UC Davis. This course refreshes my coidng skills which I can apply it directly to my current job by helping Dr. Kim, a postdoc in the Genetic Laboratory, analyzes her research on rice molecular genetics in Python. The purpose of this webpage is to show the work I have done in Statistics 141B course. Some projects and assignments links are attached down below!</p>

### Projects

__Exploratory Data Analysis Project__
<p>
This is our final project for STA 141B. I worked with three other group members, Karthika Pai, An Qi Ma, and Natalie Marcom for this project. The project is focusing on earthquakes. We thought of some different questions about earthquakes. Our goal is to answer these questions by using the skills we learned in STA 141B. All four of us use four significant datasets, so we divided the project into four parts. You can view our project by simply clicking on the 4 parts that are listed below:</p>

1. [Earthquakes in the World](https://github.com/karthikapai/earthquakes/blob/master/Earthquakes%20in%20the%20World%20(Part%201).ipynb)

2. [Earthquakes in the USA](https://github.com/karthikapai/earthquakes/blob/master/Earthquake_in_the_USA_part2.ipynb)

3. [Correlation Between Earthquakes and Tsunamis](https://github.com/karthikapai/earthquakes/blob/master/project-part-3.ipynb)

4. [Correlation Between Earthquakes and Volcanos](https://github.com/karthikapai/earthquakes/blob/master/141b_final_part42.ipynb)

### Assignments

__Statistics Data Technologies (STA141b) Assignments:__

+ [Assignment 1](https://kathy940411.github.io/KathrynChiang/assignment1)

In this assignment, I used some algorithms and basic Python languages like, strings, splits, read, dictionaries, looping, and create functions.

+ [Assignment 2](https://kathy940411.github.io/KathrynChiang/assignment2/assignment2)

In this assignment, I learn to use numpy and matrix (singular value decomposition) to change the color, resolution, settings, etc. of a cat image.

+ [Assignment 3](https://kathy940411.github.io/KathrynChiang/assignment3/assignment3)

For this assignment, I learn to work with a significant amount of csv files by using os and os.path package in Python. I also learned ways to analyze a dataframe by using matplotlib package to plot them out. 

+ [Assignment 4](https://kathy940411.github.io/KathrynChiang/assignment4/assignment4)

In this assignment, I learn to use API to get the desired information from [USDA Food Composition Databases](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list). Thus, the extracted information from USDA can be recreate to a dataframe column and combine with my previous assignment (3) to form a more informative dataframe. Further, by using the new dataframe, I can answer some questions regarding nutrition values for fruits and vegetables.

+ [Assignment 5](https://kathy940411.github.io/KathrynChiang/assignment5/assignment5)

In this assignment, I would scrape text form [The California Aggie](https://theaggie.org/) by using BeautifulSoup package and some other techniques to filter the symbols, stopwords, etc. The purpose of this assignment is by getting the frequencies of the filtered words, so I will know which topic cover the most in the website or further analysis on different questions.

+ [Assignment 6](https://kathy940411.github.io/KathrynChiang/assignment6/assignment6)

For this assignment, I learn to use the basemap package to plot out the world map and combine shapfile with basemap to drawout the city of San Francisco. Also, I learn sql to collect data sets from the [San Francisco Open Data Portal](https://data.sfgov.org/) to answer some question on the assignment.


### Lab Assignments

__Discussion Assignments:__
Those are some assignments that we need to finish by the end of the week using the techniques we learned in discussions.

+ [Laboratory 1](https://kathy940411.github.io/KathrynChiang/Lab+2)

+ [Laboratory 2](https://kathy940411.github.io/KathrynChiang/Lab+3/Lab%203)

+ [Laboratory 3](https://kathy940411.github.io/KathrynChiang/Lab+4/Lab%204)
