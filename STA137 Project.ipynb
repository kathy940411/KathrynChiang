    "<strong>Part 1: Describing the Data</strong><br>The dataset we are interested is the amount of US production of milk from Jan 1994 to Dec 2005. The period specifically is split up into a 12 month period for each year, so we are roughly examining 132 months overall . We are examining 11 years in total. The figure below shows the time series plot of our data. A histogram and boxplot are made to examine any potential outliers.</p>\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "From the boxplot and histogram that we do not have any outliers that we need to remove. We also see from the plot that our variation is stable across the time, and we do not need to transform it. Therefore, there is no need to take any pre-analysis step.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<strong>Part 2: Deterministic</strong><br>\n",
    "We clearly see with the plot an overall increasing trend from 1994 to 2005 regarding the amount of milk production. Apparently, an order one polynomial is good enough to summarize the trend. Next, we will fit the seasonal components to the data after the trend is removed. We will use a set of harmonic terms to model the seasonal components. The seasonal part is\n",

    "S_t = a_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{k} (a_s \\sin(2 \\pi\\lambda_j t) + a_c \\cos(2\\pi\\lambda_j t))\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "After we remove the trend and seasonal components, we will fit a time series model to the residuals.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The fitted linear trend is . The \\begin{equation} \\hat{m}_t=-48966.984+15.236t \\end{equation} fitted linear trend and the residuals after the trend is removed are shown in the figure below.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/83NEQeM.png\">\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Next, we are going to fit the seasonal components. The fitted seasonal components are residuals are given in the following figures. \n",

    "The corresponding ACF and PACF figures are given below. \n",

    "<p>\n",
    "If we based on ACF and PACF, we will pick AR(1) model. However, the noise does not appear to be constant over time. Since ARMA model requires stationarity assumption on the series. Therefore, we cannot fit a model to the residuals directly.  Dickey-Fully Test is performed to check the stationarity assumption. The p-value is 0.0678. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis at 5% significance level. That means, the residuals are not stationary. A differencing may be performed to make the series look stationary. So we may need to perform differencing before we fit a time series model. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<strong>Part 3: Time series model</strong><br>\n",
    "After we do a non-seasonal differencing on the residuals, the result is given in the following figures. We can see the mean is now constant across time. However, the correlation is still dependent on time. So we may need to perform stationary differencing. It seems to be tedious for this project. So, we check for stationary again with Dickey-Fully Test first. Now, the new p-value is 0.01. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis at 5% significance level. That means, we can assume the series is stationary. So, we may not need to do seasonal differencing.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fevT8Ga.png\">\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Now, we can fit a ARMA model to the series. Before we fit a model, let us check the ACF and PACF again. It is hard to tell the model. But it seems to be AR(4) from PACF. Next, we will search the best model throughout ARMA models up to p=5 and q=5 based on AIC criterion.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LGUxSV0.png\">\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The best model selected is AR(4) with estimated coefficients given below\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/l0m4Z1E.png\">\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Next, we perform Box-Ljung test on the residuals. The corresponding p-value is 0.5066. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the noises are independent. Therefore, we do not see any dependent structure in the residuals after we fitted the selected time series model. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<strong>Part 4: Forecasting</strong><br>\n",
    "To do the forecasting, we first need to obtain the next 10 forecast points from trend and seasonal. When we obtain the next 10 forecasting points from the fitted model, the forecasted values are the differencing of noises. Therefore, we can cumulate sum the forecasted values and add back the value of the last noise to each of the cumulative sum values. The forecasted values of the differencing noises is given below. \n",

    "The forecasted milk production in the next 10 months in 2006 are shown in the following figure. \n",

    "<p>\n",
    "The next 10 forecasted values are shown in the following figure. The pattern of the values is approximately the same as the previous periods. However, the values are higher than the previous ones, since we have an increasing trend.\n",
